======================

This is an informal contract to ensure that all team members have a common understanding of what is expected in terms of work standards, communication, division or work, and conflict resolution.

### Definition of “good enough” for this project

*   All specified requirements and acceptance criteria within the user stories are satisfied and working as intended.
*   All team members have reviewed and approved all aspects of the application.

### Division of work

Work will be divided at the beginning of each sprint. This will be done by using the planning poker technique to assign each individual story a number of points and a priority number, and then ensuring that each team member gets an equal amount of story points. Team members will also receive stories that compliment their specific skill sets or that are based on features that they are confident with in order to improve efficiency.

### Frequency of communication

*   Platform: Discord, Teams, GitHub
*   After each sprint, we do a sprint review and sprint planning for the next iteration.
*   To keep the sprint flowing, we will post our progress updates at the end of each day, and reach out to other team members if ever help is needed. Based on the story points of each user story, we will decide on a time estimate and if more time is taken, the team member responsible for the task should ask for help. This will help prevent team members from ever getting stuck on a task and falling behind.
*   We will have a discussion whenever there is a design decision to be made.
*   Each team member is responsible for letting the rest of the team know when their work is ready for review and a new pull request has been made. Any comments on the code can be written directly on the PR. Further discussions will be required if there are ever any necessary changes that are needed after the review is complete.

### Response delays

No matter the day, replies will be expected within maximum 2 hours during business hours (9AM - 5PM). Outside this timeframe, we as a team will try to respond as quickly as possible. If a team member will be away for an extended period of time, they are responsible for letting the other members know when they will be back.

### Receiving feedback

*   Hieu:

	“I notice what you are trying to do here but it would be better practice if you do this…”

*   Brent:

	“There are a few issues with some of your implementations. I think it would be better if you did X and X instead.”

*   Ishpal:

	“Hey, it looks like you haven’t completed your task yet, is there any issue that you need help with? I think you should try to do this instead of this. ”

### In case of conflict

Facing a disagreement, we as a team will have a discussion in person or on a call in order to resolve it. This involves reminding the team member the terms in the contract, discovering the causes of the contract violation, and explaining the benefits of respecting them. As a team, on a call, we can try to understand if there is anything preventing a certain member from fulfilling the agreement and if there is anything going on. If there have been many attempts at resolving the issue and still no improvements have been made, reaching out to the teachers will be our last resort.
